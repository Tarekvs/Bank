# Bank Management System

Welcome to the Bank Management System project. This application simulates a simplified banking environment written in Java using Maven where you can manage accounts, process transactions, and maintain a persistent record of all activities.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create, view, or delete bank accounts.
- **Transactions**: Deposit or withdraw funds, and transfer money between accounts within the bank.
- **Persistence**: All account information and transactions are saved persistently using GSON and represented as JSON files.
